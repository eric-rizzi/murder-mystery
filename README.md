# Murder Mystery Debugging Exercise

This folder contains a Python port of the "Murder Mystery" debugging exercise
developed at Rutgers (the original activity was in Java). It is intended to be
used with Microsoft's `vscode`, although it can be used with any Python IDE with
a debugger that's capable of handling multiple files.

Assignment based on [Niftyâ€™s Murder Mystery](http://nifty.stanford.edu/) by
Colin Sullivan, Steven Chen, and Ana Paula Centeno.
